I find myself starting this blog as a learning journal to document a project involving converting an clunky, dull and "old-school" that uses Drupal to something airy, bright and hip! Which is why Jekyll made the perfect choice I mean whats more with the times than being able to host your blog on Github.

But first a little bit more about what led me to getting to this point. I recently graduated from Cardiff Universtiy with a degree in Computer Science with Security and Forensics therefore naturally the next step was to find a job in the vast and exhilarting world of cyber security. 

After a large number of interviews for various positions I found myself sitting in the confrence room of a company on what was going to be my last interview before I decided to take some time and travel. Two blokes walked in the room the first thing I realised is what they were wearing, it comprised of baggy jeans, cyber academy t-shirts and hoodies - you know when something just feels right? 

The interview went on and I remember having to stop and take a moment just to make sure I was infact in an interview the converstation flowed from cyber security to rock climbing with a mention of rallying - just a few of my favortie things. 

A few months later I found myself starting my first day of work as a cyber analyst with very little idea of what to expect from the next few months. Now six months in with a great deal of learning, most of the time the hard way I find myself settling into my role. 

Enough about me for now! I'll be back with a post showing how I got to writing this first page and hosting it on Github.
